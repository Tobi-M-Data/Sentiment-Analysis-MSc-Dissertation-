Predicting Box Office with Sentiment Analysis of Movie Review

## Abstract
In the dynamic world of the film industry, accurately predicting a movie’s financial success is crucial. Traditional methods have relied on factors such as genre, star power, promotion, and marketing efforts. Sentiment analysis has emerged as a transformative computational linguistics technique that is revolutionizing the art of movie box office projection.

This dissertation explores the innovative application of sentiment analysis in assessing public opinion through movie reviews. By identifying and categorizing sentiments within textual reviews, this method offers profound insights into a film’s potential appeal and audience reception. Despite the inherent challenges of data quality and language complexity, sentiment analysis has proven to be an invaluable asset in film production, marketing, and distribution, significantly enhancing the industry’s success.

The project presented herein delves into the process of utilizing sentiment analysis to predict movie financial performance. It involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the construction of a sentiment analysis model. The project found a strong positive correlation of 0.8466 between sentiment scores and box office success, indicating that movies with higher sentiment scores tend to have higher box office success. Furthermore, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model used achieved an accuracy of 99.39%, a precision of 99.62%, a recall of 99.39%, an F1 score of 99.50%, and an ROC AUC score of 99.84%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting a movie’s box office potential based on sentiment analysis of its reviews.

The objective is to achieve an advanced understanding of audience sentiments, thereby equipping filmmakers, studios, and distributors with the knowledge to make strategic decisions leading to impressive results.
